// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
function carInfo(manufacturer, modelName, ...extraOption) {
    const cInfo = {
        manufacturer,
        modelName,
        ...Object.assign({}, ...extraOption)
    };
    return cInfo;
}
;
let result = carInfo('BMW', 'i8', { color: 'blue' }, { feature: ['foldable doors', 'navigation', 'automatic power window'] });
console.log(result);
export {};
